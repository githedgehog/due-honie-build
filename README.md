# due-onie-build

This prepares our [due](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/DUE) builder which is used to build our version of [ONIE](https://github.com/githedgehog/ONIE).

The modifications we are doing to `due` are minor.
Essentially we just add the YubiHSM packages for the time being plus we fix the due build as it is broken by default.
